			<p>This is a guide on HUBzero web components frontend development and is work in progress.</p>
			<p>The project's ultimate goal is to include the guidelines on standard HTML markup as well as CSS naming conventions used across all frontend code at HUBzero. The big idea of this whole guide is to fine-tune and polish the code to provide clean, consistent, flexible and easy way to write new extensions for HUBzero. Also it should serve as a repository of commonly used UI elements and other frontend code constructs to support the consistent markup and CSS naming across all parts of the hub.</p>

			<p>Happier coding, less bugs, faster development &ndash; this is essentially the reason this project started on the first place.</p>
